## Intro

Custom classes are an important feature of Python and necessary for OOP.  In this file, we are creating two custom objects necessary for further operations. 

# SSR Class (IBM job role)

```
class  SSR(object):
    # counter for total number of SSR instances
    ssr_counter = 0
    def __init__(self, first, last, employee_serial, specialization, band_level, pay, employment_length):
        self.first = first
        self.last = last
        self.employee_serial = employee_serial 
        self.specialization = specialization
        self.band_level = band_level
        self.pay = pay
        self.employment_length = employment_length  
        # Adds 1 to the counter for every instance of the object     
        SSR.ssr_counter +=1

    def ssr_dataframe(self):
        return {'First Name': self.first, 'Last Name': self.last, 'Employee_Serial': self.employee_serial, 'Specialization': self.specialization, 'Band Level': self.band_level, 'Pay': self.pay, 'Employment Length': self.employment_length}
        
```
Here you can see the SSR object is being initialized with several attributes, such as first name, last name, etc.  There is a counter method within the class object that we can call upon anytime to calculate the total number of SSR's working at IBM at any given time.  

# Division Class (IBM Divisions)

```
class Division:
    
    def __init__(self, division, max_employees):
        self.division = division
        self.max_employees = max_employees
        self.employees = []
    division_counter = 0   

    # A class method to add new employees to division per rules business logic
    def add_employee_division(self, employee):
        if len(self.employees) <  self.max_employees:
            self.employees.append(employee)
            return True 
        return False
        # Adds 1 to the counter for every instance of the object 
        Division.division_counter +=1

    def division_dataframe(self):
        return {'Division': self.division, 'Employees': self.employees, 'Max Employees': self.max_employees}

```

The basic idea behind this object is to be able to use some business logic to determine max amount of employees/SSR allowed in each division and to add SSR to the Division object.  After the initialization, we can call the add_employee_division method, which will allow us to add employees to whichever Division Object we want.

## SSR Object
```
First Name Last Name Employee_Serial Specialization  Band Level    Pay  Employment Length
0    Brandon    Mochel          4J4122  Power Systems           4  45000                 23
1     Melisa    Mochel          4J4123       System X           2  38000                 12
2      Blake     Birch          4J4358     Lenovo PCD           1  35000                  4
```
## Division Object
### Notice the object being printed out within each Division Instance (GTS/TSS) - Success!
```
  Division                                          Employees  Max Employees
0      GTS  [<__main__.SSR object at 0x000001406FBD0610>, ...            500
1      TSS      [<__main__.SSR object at 0x000001406FBD05B0>]            300
```
This file only touches the surface of what is possible with the use of Custom Objects in Python.  With multiple similar objects, you are able to create parent classes (more generalized classes) and child classes which can extract or inherit methods and properties from the parent classes (Inheritance).
